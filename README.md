# Identidog - A Dog Breed Identification App

![app_screenshot](walkthrough_imgs/app_screenshot.jpg)

This is the main repository for the app Identidog üê∂. As the screenshot shows, the app takes an input image showing a dog or a person and returns the top resembling breeds. One may try out and use the app in any web browser by visiting this [page](https://huggingface.co/spaces/alexeikud/identidog) served by the AI/ML platform [Hugging face spaces](https://huggingface.co/).

## Repo Layout
The repo is organised as follows:

- The root folder contains the README.md, (MIT) Licence information, the configuration files: ``requirements.txt`` and ``environment.yml``, a project notebook, ``walkthrough.ipynb`` [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexeikud/identidog/blob/master/walkthrough.ipynb), containing a detailed walkthrough of the development of the app , and the folder "walkthrough_imgs" containing the corresponding images.

- The folder "app" contains the main app script ``app.py``, the required images and models, and a copy of the Huggingface Readme.

## How Identidog came to be
Identidog was developed as a fun machine learning project for trying out identification of the mixed-breed dogs living in my home. Although dog identification apps have already been available since [2016](https://news.microsoft.com/features/fetch-new-microsoft-garage-app-uses-artificial-intelligence-to-name-that-breed/), I found most give unsatisfactory results for mixed breeds - and figured I would obtain a better understanding of the methods and limitations by making my own app.

In addition, the project was meant to help cement techniques I learned from fastai's deep-learning [course](https://course.fast.ai/).

## How Identidog works
The app essentially strings together three image classifiers:

- A classifier which detects human faces in image
- A classifier which detects whether a dog is in the image
- A classifier which identifies dog breeds from among 133 of some of the most well-known ones.

For the first two classifiers we load pretrained models: a front-facing haarcascades model from [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv[) for face detection and the VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/), pretrained on the [Imagenet](https://www.image-net.org/) database.

The breed identifier was created by fine-tuning a pretrained CNN ResNet (also trained on Imagenet) to our specific dataset of 133 dog breeds using the fastai's deep-learning library.

## Acknowlegements
- This project was based on this [repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification) from Udacity. In particular, the training data and template for the walkthrough were obtained there.
- Fastai's deep-learning course and [book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) were invaluable resources in learning how to train and deploy a CNN classifier using transfer learning.
- The app is dedicated to Cosmo, Loki and Monty.
